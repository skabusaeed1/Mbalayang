# MbalayangProject

We have cloned a e-commarce application called Mbalayang.com It simply meant allowing to Book a Hotel. Over time it has evolved to provide multiple benefits on one platform for all.

In this Project, We have tried to implement some of the functionalities of the application like search and along with these we have tried sorting functionalities and the User flow of booking a hotel and applying best available offers.
